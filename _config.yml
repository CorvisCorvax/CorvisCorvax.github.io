  	When I was young, I was always taught that success was making enough money to provide for your family.
  As I sit in my late 30s I came to a realization.  John Lennon when asked what he wanted to be when
  he grew up, responded, "I want to be happy."  His teacher quaffed, "You didn't understand the assignment." John quickly replied, "You don't understand life."  Feel free to dream. Don't measure your success by paychecks, but by the happiness you can share with the world and obtain for yourself.  Happiness is the only thing I want everyone to be greedy for.
